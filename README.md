## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
This project was created with the aim of helping users memorize information more efficiently. The application consists of a set of flashcards that can be used to learn anything from programming concepts to words in a new language. The main features of the project include:

- Componentization of page elements with React in separate files
- Storing dynamic page information (such as decks and flashcards) as arrays or JavaScript objects
- Creation of flashcards that initially appear upside down and numbered on the screen, hiding the term or question they contain
- Possibility to see the question or term corresponding to each flashcard by clicking on the "play" arrow
- Availability of the response to the flashcard by clicking on the "turn" icon
- Buttons to indicate the recall level of the answer given by the user
- Visual indication of flashcard status

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- React
- Styled Components
- Vercel

React was chosen because it is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Styled Components for styling, and Vercel for hosting and deployment.
